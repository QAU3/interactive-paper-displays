# Designing interactive paper displays by interlacing physical and digital content using horizontal touchscreens

This repository serves as a dedicated resource for supplementary materials associated with the thesis titled "Designing Interactive Paper Displays by Interlacing Physical and Digital Content Using Horizontal Touchscreens" The purpose of this thesis is to obtain the degree of Doctor in Computer Science at the University of Primorska in Koper, Slovenia. Here, you will find a wealth of additional materials, including data, illustrations, code, and any other relevant content that complements and supports the research and findings presented in the main thesis document. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive and accessible resource for those interested in delving deeper into the research conducted as part of this doctoral pursuit.

This repository is organized into three distinct folders, each containing supplementary material for the three foundational papers of the thesis: 

- [DPP] [Dynamic pinhole paper: Interacting with horizontal displays through perforated paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3567720)
- [LMUP] [Light-meup: Back-print illumination paper display with multi-stable visuals](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3570333)
- [THS] [The Hybrid Stylus: A Multi-Surface Active Stylus for Interacting with and Handwriting on Paper, Tabletop Display or Both](https://doi.org/10.3390/s22187058)

Please note that all materials and documentation derived from the thesis work have been or are intended to be appropriately referenced.
