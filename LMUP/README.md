# # Supplementay materials of Light-meup: Back-print illumination paper display with multi-stable visuals

## Index
This suppplementary materials sections is organized as follows:
- [Online simulator](https://lightmeup.onrender.com/). An online prototype of the simulator.  
- Code. The core calculation for generating colors in the simulator is implemented in app.py, which uses the Flask framework. Additionally, a folder containing the spectral data used to produce these colors is included. The user interface (UI) of the simulator is implemented in ReactJS, and you can also access the source code used in the UI. It's important to note that this code represents a prototype, and it was developed when I had limited programming skills. The intention behind providing the source code is to maintain transparency and offer insight into the methodology employed for my research. If you have any further questions or require additional information, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm here to assist with any inquiries or clarifications you may need.

Thank you for checking this section.
